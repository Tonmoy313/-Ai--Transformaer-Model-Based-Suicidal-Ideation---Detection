Really long post, hit the character limit. I don\\'t really expect this to get read. Posting just in case I am wrong about that. So much uncertainty, fear, self doubt. Trying to have faith in myself, hope for everything else. Blegh.I am really unhappy with my life, but I also feel stuck.\\n\\nI work at a job that I used to have a lot of motivation for. I still look up to all the people around me and think they are great people. I had some interpersonal issues that in the past, I\\'ve been able to look past, or at least suppress feeling for, by coping in unhealthy ways. I don\\'t like blaming people. \\n\\nI had a seizure also, at work. This affected my performance, I fell into a deep depression after, unable to deal with knowing people saw me like that. \\n\\nI started to do a little better at some point. But it comes and goes while my mood continues to sink. I have trouble getting into work on some days, even though I do everything else well. I have been eating better, sleeping regularly, and so on. I have no social life. I have no activities I enjoy doing. Everything I do at home is in the attempt to do something that will make something better - personal improvement, creating something someone values. I recognize the irony of this, not being able to get into work and instead, trying to compensate by making something at home.\\n\\nI worry about my future deeply. I just feel like I am watching myself fall apart and there is nothing I can do. I don\\'t want things to get so bad that I wind up going through the whole hospitalization out patient therapy cycle, because that really makes me feel quite terrible about myself. I know what needs to be done in my life sometimes, but I have trouble actually doing it much of the time.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t seem to be getting better, and I don\\'t want to be put on more medication or anything like that. I don\\'t know if I need a new job or a new attitude. I thought I had friends, just two. But one wants much more than I am wiling to give, and that makes me uncomfortable to the point of wanting to disconnect from him. The other, I have managed to work on behaviors that allow me to not ask too much from them, but when I get too needy I feel like I am just giving them lists of reasons to want to disconnect with me, much like I feel with this other person. \\n\\nSo right now I am not talking really to anyone. I have a life coach I talk to, that I  have tried to tackle deep issues with, but some things I seem so stubborn on changing. I am not talking with my two friends out of fear of not being a good friend, fear of getting confused socially, mentally, emotionally, fear of giving up pieces of myself that I don\\'t want to give. Fear of convincing myself things are fine the way they are. \\n\\nI\\'m afraid of letting new people into my life. I am afraid that I am perpetuating negative thinking patterns that lead to self sabotage and self defeat. I am told that I overthink everything but I can\\'t just sit here and have sad and bad emotions without a clue in what to do in how to change them, without thinking. If I stop trying to think of what may work, I might as well give up and just die, because I would have resigned myself to suffering without change.\\n\\nI keep thinking I have to change things about myself, but I don\\'t know what I can change for positive effect. I feel paralyzed. \\n\\nI want to do things in life. When I go out to do things, it is very rare that I enjoy anything. So I spend long periods of time alone instead. Sometimes it seems like I am choosing between depression and worse depression, so I should just pick the least depressing thing, even though I am going to be depressed. Sometimes it feels like, if I try to explain the hopelessness in that, no one can empathize, or if some part of them can, they don\\'t want to. So I get a lot of advice on things I have already tried, or things that hurt. \\n\\nI feel very, very hopeless right now. I feel like that is how people see me too, but I try to not let that fear affect me so much that it affects my ability to do things.\\n\\nThis keeps coming back and happening. It doesn\\'t seem to go away. I get angry and want to fight and want to prove I am not permanently broken. But at the same time I can\\'t deny my deep unhappiness. And I hate having people in my life see me like this and not be able to change it for me. I hate having no one in my life either. I hate feeling like there is something wrong with me that I can\\'t appreciate what I have, even if I want to. There is a lot I am grateful for but I just often feel like I don\\'t fit, and like I am perpetually disconnected, and like this is my fault, and in my darkest periods, like I deserve to feel this way, like I am being punished for something, or I am punishing myself, because other people or I or some combination of those things feels that I deserve it. I feel like others see me as choosing to be this way, because there is always more I could do. I feel like I need to make myself do more. But I don\\'t know what. Everything feels either, like it hurts, or the same degree of numbness and disconnection. \\n\\nI feel trapped in my own misery, and I feel afraid to let others know, I feel afraid to ask for help from normal resources because I have felt attacked and judged harshly in those places. My mom thinks I have a medical condition like something wrong with my hormones or some disease. I\\'ve been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses from many professionals over the years, and sometimes those diagnosis conflict and other times they seem to perpetuate themselves merely because I have been attached to that label despite not exhibiting the behavior required for a diagnosis. I\\'ve been medicated too much, with many different side effects, that I don\\'t want to try new medication. I am tired of having to take these drugs when they never seem to help and often seem to have some unignorable side effect that makes me feel worse off, not better.\\n\\nThe last additional medication I was told to go on was an antipsychotic, and I just think the industry is going in a terrible direction because of that. I\\'m not psychotic. I\\'m unhappy with my life, and I don\\'t know how a pill is supposed to make me figure out what I want to do with my life, what makes me happy, what I want to pursue. I don\\'t think I am mentally ill because I have no answers for myself. I don\\'t think I am mentally ill because I don\\'t know what \\'normal\\' feels like because I have been on so much medication, or so stuck in my head over-analyzing myself because of labels and 5 minute diagnosis where I never have enough time to explain everything without raising something that has come to be identified as a red flag. I don\\'t want to be observed and studied with or without my consent. I don\\'t want people to extrapolate ideas about my future behavior using a combination of data about me and data about people that are not me. I don\\'t want people to tell me that I need to remold how I think. How I think is not the problem. Figuring out what the hell I can do to make this better for myself without feeling like I\\'m just pretending is the problem that I can\\'t solve and am tired of various industries, researchers, scientists and so on pretending to. \\n\\nIf I choose to express myself this way, my depression is just mild discontent. Every word I say matters because it indicates some severity, but at any given moment I couldn\\'t tell you the difference between any of them. I am chronically suicidal but I am just overall mildly unhappy and when I don\\'t feel that way, I just feel numb. I feel like I have no hope for getting actual understanding such that I can be helped. \\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'m particularly abnormal in my fears nor do I think they are unwarranted. I don\\'t think my expectations or evaluations of my reality are very far from the truth. I don\\'t think I am pretending to not know what to do. I don\\'t think I have some deep rooted source of my problems that needs to be confronted and come to ritualistic closure in order to move past my feelings and suddenly sprout desire for doing things. I don\\'t think my brain is chemically imbalanced, and even if it is, I don\\'t think medication will fix it. I don\\'t know if there is such a thing as a balanced brain when people only listen to so much evidence and then just decide at some point to stop listening. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what it\\'s like to feel like I am actually being understood. I don\\'t know what it is like to feel like I matter. I feel useless, worthless. And the best I can hope for is to be someone else\\'s puppet, acting out a play that validates their belief system, and using that validation to find some sense of peace or belief in sanity in myself. I don\\'t feel like pretending just to slowly transform my description of myself from \\'numb\\' to \\'content\\'. I don\\'t feel like I am fixed just because I am advised to use different words. \\n\\nI still feel the same when I come home. Lonely in that I feel disconnected. Demotivated because the difficult time I am going through can\\'t be ignored and actually does affect me. Wanting to ignore it to give myself belief that I can do better. Wanting to change the way I see things to convince myself into doing better. I don\\'t do well alone. I don\\'t feel like I do well reaching out, for the most part, either. I feel like a failure and every time I can\\'t meet expectations and descriptions that indicate mental health or personal wellness, that I am dooming myself. Each one of those data points and observations just add up in an equation that attempts to predict my future. \\n\\nI\\'m afraid of letting anyone understand me because of judgement, because what they assume about me affects how I see myself. I\\'m afraid of people just lying to me to make me feel temporarily better. I am afraid of lying to myself over things I am aware and/or things I may not know. I am afraid of having observations about me being used to make a connection from one thing to another. I am afraid of feeling like I must do everything at a bare minimum level of perfection, otherwise everything will fall apart. I am afraid of ignoring important things out of the advice to avoid overthinking. I am afraid of following advice too strictly or too loosely. I am afraid of getting lost in someone else\\'s head. I am afraid of losing myself, afraid of one day waking up and finding that I hate what I used to like about myself. I am afraid that I have already been through this multiple times and I just keep pretending it hasn\\'t happened. I am afraid that I am wrong enough about everything to deserve being ignored. I am afraid of being used instead of helped when attention is given to me. I am afraid of holding people to too high of standards. I am afraid of dragging people down with me. I am afraid of giving people reasons to not speak to me. I am afraid of disappointing myself and others that depend on me. I am afraid that no one depends on me because they all see me as an invalid. \\n\\nI try to work through this stuff in my journal and in therapy and just, anything. I am afraid of being a hypocrite every time I have an emotional reaction to something I do not like or want. I feel like I am conditioned to generalize all experience I have had in order to make continual improvement. I rarely let myself feel good about anything that should theoretically be seen as good because I am not reaching that bare minimum of perfection. I am tired of feeling like I am mentally ill, retarded, handicapped, an invalid - because I do things differently. I am tired of feeling like the only people that try to understand me are people I pay to, and even then it\\'s usually just pretend, until enough time has gone by so that more parts of me mirror parts of them. \\n\\nI am tired of always thinking my thinking is mostly pointless and does nothing. I am tired of feeling like I can\\'t have confidence in my thoughts and beliefs without vigilant external supervision. I am sad feeling as though my mind is a precious thing that has been violated. I am sad feeling like this will be seen as me being melodramatic, or like I have misidentified my actual problem. I feel like I don\\'t know what my problem is and neither does anyone else. And to expect no one to care about it enough unless it\\'s their problem too, and like that\\'s just life and what everyone goes through and I should be able to deal with it. That kind of reaction makes me feel like I am just not fit for living, while at the same time being told I am not allowed to die. \\n\\nI can\\'t seem to find my own sense of self value completely independently. But I feel like there is something real that is wrong between myself and others, that I can\\'t identify. And I don\\'t know if it is my fault or their fault or no one\\'s fault. I don\\'t know if I am supposed to accept it or try to change it. I don\\'t know if I am only allowed to change it in ways deemed acceptable, or if I actually have the same freedoms as everyone else, or the same freedoms as the people who have more certainty in themselves and less doubt. I don\\'t know how to have faith in myself without someone else telling me I am allowed to. \\n\\nThis is long. I can\\'t blame anyone if they don\\'t read it or see it as pointless or too complicated or like some kind of twisted puzzle. I don\\'t want to be seen like my intentions are bad. I don\\'t want to be seen as dangerous or unconcerned with other people. I don\\'t want to be seen as lacking empathy or understanding. I don\\'t want to be seen as being lazy or just \\'wrong\\', ill fitted, invalid. I want to believe the positive things people say about me without questioning them. I don\\'t want to feel like I have to understand everything in order to understand some things. \\n\\nI don\\'t want to feel hopeless. I don\\'t want to feel like I am self sabotaging because I can\\'t do things in the ways considered \\'right\\'. I don\\'t want to feel like I am a broken person or a crazy person or a stupid person or a stubborn asshole because I want things to make sense to me and I want to have faith in my identification of various pursuits enough such that I can believe in them enough to know they will help me feel better, not worse, even though I may have bad experience where things were connected incorrectly, and seen as causal to my happiness instead of being rigorously defined as unrelated. \\n\\nMy problems are too long and boring for anyone to care to deal with. Maybe I wind up making them so unique that no one wants to bother trying to understand me. Or I just can\\'t simplify everything down to something small and easily digestible precisely enough to remove ambiguity, nor can I write so eloquently or speak so pleasantly such that I draw people in and make listening enjoyable. I don\\'t know when I have said too much or too little. Left open too much room for interpretation, or explained it so sufficiently and correctly that anyone who does listen gets trapped in the same mental hell I am in. How to believe people when they say that can\\'t happen or doesn\\'t happen, without knowing whether there is the same speck of doubt I have, that eats away at me when I am alone with my thoughts. That makes me feel alone without knowing whether I cause myself to be alone. That makes me wonder whether this is my fault or just something that happens to some people. \\n\\nIt is miserable. Venting here, I dunno. I don\\'t know if I am just stuck with the same thoughts that can be corrected with CBT or DBT or whether I question those things and think about them so much that they are not effective to me. Not because I am on disproving the techniques. But because I can\\'t bring myself to believe in them, when it is just as easy for me to see what is flawed in them as it is for me to see what is flawed in my own thinking. \\n\\nI am supposed to pay attention to the present, mindfulness. Stuff like that just makes me nervous, like I am either waiting for something to happen, or waiting for myself to do something stupid. I am overwhelmingly more likely to have negative or neutral, emotionally numb expectations, with fear that my emotional numbness will be interpreted as callousness and lacking empathy for those around me. I am afraid of focusing so much on myself and what bothers me that I will be judged as being self centered and self focused and stuck in my head and uncaring of others - therefore undeserving of any positive social benefits. Just because I don\\'t make it obvious to see that I care and think about other people doesn\\'t mean that is what I am like internally. I am tired of feeling like, as long as all the outside observations about me make sense and stuff, that that means something is wrong with me if I can\\'t be okay with that. I am afraid that I do not afford other people the same courtesy - because I judge how I have been judged over a collection of experiences or a few extremes or a combination of both, cherry picked to prove a point I accepted as fact before allowing myself to experience differently - assuming I know what I don\\'t because the data of the past weighs on the present and the future heavily - in terms of predictions, expectations, actions, decisions, judgments, bias, etc.\\n\\nI am afraid that I am the biggest fool for fully embracing my uncertainty as the only thing I knowingly can accept completely without doubt. I can certainly choose to assume other things, and use some sense of thoughtful intuition to weight those beliefs in order to make decisions,in order to asses the risks and rewards, in order to determine probability of outcomes - in order to do anything besides feel trapped in a thought cycle that won\\'t let me decide on anything aside from doing what I am currently doing. How to have confidence that I have escaped the thought cycle without feeling as though I am simply distracting myself away from seeing it, and allowing myself to be happily ignorant to the effects and consequences of assuming. Knowing that everything, every little thing I do could potentially have big consequences or small, and I have no way of knowing the difference when I am trying something new. No way of knowing whether other people see it as something new or just doing the same thing. No way of knowing whether other people will see me as stubbornly spinning my wheels or see me as stupid, or creating problems where none exist, whether they believe I am doing the wrong thing, whether they will purposefully use their opinion to prove themselves correct, trying in any way they can to illustrate that doing what I do has negative consequences, whether it is direct or indirect punishment, testing my empathy and capacity to care for other people, testing whether I am doing enough or need to lower my expectations because it is the gigantic chasm between my ideal identity and what they see me as that is what they see as \\'the problem\\'. \\n\\nOverthinking me, while saying it\\'s for my benefit when it seems more for their own sanity, and then acting out incredulously, with aggression, hostility, and other forms of unhealthy, symptomatically ill behavior when I copy rigorous, scientifically backed, analytical methods in order to understand how they have come to see me the way they have, and why they believe that doing the things they do will help me, when nearly all of that data ignores the imbalance between clinician and patient that comes with being analyzed, observed, restrained, labeled, medicated, diagnosed, etc - all in the attempt to prevent bad things from happening. Of course, now I am not even considered a patient in the institutions of mental health in my country. I am a client, a consumer. I am seeking a service or a product, which is a different, better, improved version of me - one that gives me confidence that I will be able to avoid experiencing whatever it is I am afraid of, whatever bad I have observed or seen happen. One that promises to fix me while simultaneously telling me that I shouldn\\'t see myself as broken.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter. Probably just a broken record no one wants to listen to, or can take seriously, because there\\'s all this data that suggests my points should be taken with a grain of salt. My mental illness has warped me and affects the way I think and act. And somehow I am supposed to find confidence in myself enough to not be terrified of myself, enough to choose and do things while accepting imperfection without calling it incompetence, enough to know what is necessary to be perfect with respect to and what can be granted some slack... I mean it would make sense if it made sense, the problem is life doesn\\'t always make sense, but sometimes people just don\\'t make sense and pretend that they do, and if these people happen to be in positions of authority or power, then they will throw everything they can at you to avoid agreeing, showing weakness, giving in, accepting that they can no longer be so certain in their methods, or that neither acting with authority or doubt is correlated to what actually works. Sometimes people just pretend to know things and pretend that they don\\'t realize they are pretending. \\n\\nThe only thing that I can say with myself is that I am not in a position of power over other people. I don\\'t dictate to others how to live their lives, behave, act, speak, think, do. I do judge some things and I often worry about whether what I do is a waste of effort, or whether there is nothing I can expect or should because although the identities of the people who are correct may change, the underlying problem is still there. \\n\\nWhen I think I am correct in my beliefs I have simply redefined the problem to ignore what no longer affects me. And I will fight stubbornly to ensure that everything I have worked for is not taken away from me, especially after so much has been unfairly taken. And I will have full confidence in my assessment of myself, even if no one else can prove it.\\n\\nI have never understood how people have this much faith in themselves to behave this way. I am starting to, in a way that makes sense to me. I don\\'t know if that is a good thing or if I am doing exactly to others what has been done to me. Or whether I am doing something different and what happens to others is out of my control at some human point. I hate feeling like it is both necessary to be judged by people in order to judge myself honestly, but impossible to know if the metrics by which they judge are correct. \\n\\nAnd I am always finding reasons that I should expect more from others than I do from myself. Even if everyone has just turned into one single blob person and I am arguing a losing battle, because I can\\'t delete memories, or the way things seem to have affected me, and I don\\'t know whether it\\'s right or wrong to change how I perceive those things, because changing my perception from the experience has caused me to not have faith in my ability to perceive or understand how I feel presently, which makes it pointless to try to identify my present feelings. This is an argument that can go on forever, and it has become so polarized that very few people are willing to listen to it without trying to blame my problems on something else that they identify as troubling. Or that society sees as having an overall net negative effect. \\n\\nI rarely feel like people see the amount of effort and thought I have put into this, without feeling like if I expose it in particular contexts, that I will be labeled a number of things, all in order to protect other people from me, to protect myself from myself, to protect myself from seeing myself the way other people choose to see me, and choose to believe in as an objective judgement on good/bad , positive/negative, good/evil, healthy/unhealthy, wise/unwise, smart/stupid, sane/crazy, etc. There are many formal words and definitions that look objective on the outside, but only have meaning because they can be defined subjectively. It just seems to be believed that there is a tipping point where subjectivity turns into objectivity. But that is just mob mentality, group think. There is no reason to believe that the subjective experiences of many people can be used to divine truth about all, forever, no matter how careful and cautious the methodology of divining understanding is made. Eventually, in some instances, belief must string ideas together. \\n\\nEventually these things sometimes boil down to ritual and faith. Everyone does this, and they do it minimally, unless they enjoy living a life of terrifying uncertainty, or have a belief that there is something noble and valuable about being able to depend on faith and ritual when all they have is doubt. And I do the same thing, just applied differently. The problem is that what I do specifically, things I share about myself - these things are used to infer how I likely behave otherwise.\\n\\nSo if it is permissible and valid to extrapolate and predict behavior in contexts different than those observed; it should be permissible for me to take whatever is identified as good or healthy and use it to predict any outcome. If people are allowed to believe that they can rise above their subjective biases by designing data collection to look as opposite as possible from the methods of collecting anecdotes and biases, then I should be able to use the same kind of thinking to reason about the things that affect me. And I suppose I can live with the same expectation that those who judge me can expect me to change just as much as I expect them to. And I can be ignored on repeat or dismissed, and if that happens it should be healthy and okay for me to do the same. And the only reason I am not a hypocrite is because I haven\\'t awarded myself the authority to tell people whom I am not, how to live their lives, or how to judge the value or morality or ethics behind what they do. I do not benefit from the happiness or comfort that comes with certainty and confidence. I have absolute uncertainty, constantly, because I know that sometimes everything can be done correctly and it still doesn\\'t matter. \\n\\nThis I can accept. I can no longer accept the judgement of myself that I am not trying hard enough, or doing enough, or have enough willpower, or intelligence, or have sacrificed enough, or am valuable enough, or have proven myself worthy enough enough to deserve happiness. I can\\'t accept the judgement that my choice to do things in a specific way is unhealthy or indicative of some deeper problem, of which can only be fixed by myself, but only in specific contexts where some authority approves of the why, the way, the how, and so on. I can\\'t accept the judgement that I am doing this out of fun or laziness, or for some other careless, stupid, oversimplified reason, that is anything else than that of necessity. I can\\'t expect anyone to understand or care enough to both understand me and believe that my choices are done out of necessity and not of my own choosing. That I can\\'t just decide to do things differently because someone told me to, no matter how much data they have to support their conclusions. That I can\\'t just move past the fact that often times, those things remain enforced and granted authority as being representative of the ideal - only because people are terrified of the consequences, and are unable to determine whether they are terrified for good reason, or because someone wants them to be terrified because someone benefits from that. All of these things can rest of premises that only prove themselves to be true because they are believed to be true when people are exhausted, scared, confused, desperate for anything that will indicate a direction. My direction seems to be to call it out for what it is while accepting that I have no idea what it will do. It could only affect me as I may be the only one to bother reading what I write. It could affect other people negatively, and be pointed to as the root source of a problem. It could be dissected, discredited, ripped to shreds, pointing out every assumption, logical fallacy, and hypocrisy I exhibit. People could do that with the belief that pointing these things out will make me better off in the long run. People could do nothing out of fear of pushing me over an edge I claim to be dangling on. People could choose to hurt me precisely because my views will create conflict that makes their lives less enjoyable or more difficult to manage. People could choose to hurt me for the fun of it. People could be very nice and very polite while still believing I am insane, or stupid, or retarded. People could just encourage me about everything they see as wrong with me, without seeing that that means that they are making me aware of how wrong they see me to be. \\n\\nSometimes it doesn\\'t matter how kind, or scientific, rigorous, careful, or cautious one is are, when one judges people and forms expectations that create power imbalances, and imply some sort of objectively measurable inequality, that ultimately results in a negative image of \\'the other\\'. Descartes said \\'hell is other people\\', and I wish merely believing he is wrong or having enough doubt in his authority and experiences and methods of explaining - I wish either of those things would make things change for how I see things. But then I am just choosing to ignore what actually happens, or I am choosing to use language that lacks emotion, and lacks a sense of demanding urgency and attention. That minimizes and dismisses other ways of experiencing and explaining the life one has lived by labeling it \\'ill\\', \\'incorrect\\',  \\'imbalanced\\' or \\'harmful\\'. \\n\\nIs the point to take a non-conforming person and then apply a bunch of (some very lazy, very careless) techniques in the effort to make the outside of it (the person) look and act in a way that sneakily suggests to those studying it that what they are doing is right and effective? So when they go home, alone, or with family - they can have some comfort in that? What happens if people aren\\'t actually acting altruistically, but with self deceptive behaviors and thought patterns and denial, for selfish reasons they present as selfless? Just because a large enough group of them got together and thought about things enough that they were able to record all the affirmations and techniques they use to ensure a steady sense of personal well being? What if the mental health industry is filled with emotional vampires that use a variety of borderline techniques to sustain themselves and their beliefs - even when their beliefs can be shown to be demonstrably harmful?\\n\\nI\\'m sure if anyone reads that they will dismiss me as crazy. Or whatever. I\\'m used to wondering why no one listens to me about things that matter for long enough that I have come to expect one outcome or another. I would be genuinely surprised if someone agreed with me and was able to change things as a result. \\n\\nOtherwise, if I go off to get mental help lately, I just feel like I am either using my taxes so the government can pay my providers to let me do their work for them, or I am directly paying them to do their work for them. At some point my arguing and thinking become annoying. I\\'ve been traumatized from being restrained, laughed at, mocked, and involuntarily committed - on the sole basis that my behavior of truth seeking seems to imply being a danger to myself.\\n\\nI do not give authority arbitrarily. I do not do things that do not make sense to me - meaning no one has been able to explain sufficiently why to do those things, or has been willing to offer an account of their own personal experience from which I can derive my own conclusions. Apparently that is too much to ask of people who want to tell others how to live, and want to punish them in some way if they choose to do differently, if they bother to not only have, but to exhibit independent thought. Apparently non-conformity is mental illness, and mental illness is so serious that it must be heavily controlled. \\n\\nIn a lot of these places, at least the hospitals and facilities I have been to - there is a big expectation on the patient to learn to think clearly, and with guidance - to identify flaws in reasoning, with little to no expectation that the same demands are made of those who make the demands. That seems to be too much to ask for. My past behavior implies my future behavior unless I can prove somehow I\\'ve changed. And for most people the only proof is that some combination of what I am doing is working for me. And when things aren\\'t working out, that is sometimes all the proof people need to determine that the problem lies with me and something either specifically characteristic of me and others, because of that correlation between behavior. I feel like it is only at the very tippy top of academia that people are willing to even face their own uncertainty - because they have been placed in that position because of their ability to think outsides of themselves. Being in the position that directs outcomes explicitly must be very hard on a person who doesn\\'t have something to fall back on to blame or have faith in. Being in that kind of position much eventually lead to an internal awareness of self doubt, if it isn\\'t there already. And letting others see that vulnerability may have been something they needed to do on the way up, but it might just not be working for them any longer. They might need to do things in a different way and accept that the things they fall back on and rely on when faced with that doubt may no longer work for them predictably or without error in anticipated outcome. Sometimes we get so habituated to things we do routinely, we become so convinced that the way we do things is good enough that it doesn\\'t need to be fucked with, questioned, or changed - that without direct confrontation proving that the way we are doing things is flawed, we become blind to the objectivity of the situation. Blind to data, observations, ideas, and valid arguments that prove otherwise. Blind to our own hypocrisy, and unable to change because we don\\'t know how, no one does. \\n\\nBeing told to just accept some things hurts. Being told that there are shortcuts to feeling better hurts, especially when things hurt so much, one is used to acting out of desperation to alleviate that pain. Being told to just, sheepishly accept guilt and mistake because \\'it\\'s obvious\\', hurts. Being told that admitting defeat through acknowledgement of mistake, throwing ourselves at the mercy and feet of others to beg forgiveness for doing an obvious wrong - out of terror to avoid more social punishment, ostracism, discrimination - this hurts too. Forcing people to do these things and suggesting that they will lead to feeling better even if they feel bad to do. That is just saying that \"I won\\'t treat you fairly or nicely until you figure out what I am judging you for, and you find some way to stop doing it\". Even if people blame something else that works for them without shattering their ego - let people blame human ignorance instead of laziness. For healthy people, there is so much behavior that can be distorted through choice words to sound ill. \\n\\nI hate feeling like someone in authority over me actually believes that if they force me to change the way I use words, they have made me better. Telling me to say I am frustrated instead of angry. \\n\\nI dunno. I am not of the illusion that I am perfect or that I can only improve independently, or only in the way I choose and am comfortable with. I am willing to do things differently if I am afforded the same courtesy. And I don\\'t think that is my biting my nose off to spite my face, or swallowing the poison and expecting the other person to die. I don\\'t hold onto this anger. I accept it as something crappy that happens in life, and I continue to feel chronically suicidal when I feel powerless to change it, powerless to redefine myself where it matters the most to me, and powerless to even start a dialogue or conversation where my label of mental illness isn\\'t used to discredit my capacity to think and reason effectively. Maybe I am ill because I think someone might care enough to read all of this, and maybe I am ill to believe that putting this out there can result in something other than negative or more of the same for me. \\n\\nInsanity is doing the same thing over and over, that can be patronizing. It implies that the only determinant that matters is effective change. And sometimes that can just be luck or chance or random. Sometimes you can try to change everything and still feel exactly the same. Only to be left with the thought that maybe something is just wrong with you, so badly, that you have pushed everyone out of your life who could help you, and you don\\'t know whether you can undo it or not, without completely sacrificing everything you like about yourself, use to identify yourself, use to define yourself, without sacrificing your sense of values, of morality, of ethics, esteem, confidence, faith, etc. And you know throwing all of those things away arbitrarily may lead to greater unhappiness. But there\\'s no way to know without knowing. So you feel forced into it, trapped, hopeless, and despairing that all everyone sees about you is something they identify as obviously problematic and the cause of your problems, knowing that even if you could explain fully in a perfectly sensical way, they would discount it. And knowing that you can\\'t expect any better, because you can\\'t do any better yourself. And knowing that expecting any better would be hypocrisy unless you can prove to yourself that you can do better. And not having any real way to determine whether you have succeeded or not, because at some point, you stopped trusting your mind, your feelings, your awarenesses, your intuitions. Stopped trusting in all of it foundationally. And that makes it impossible to experience improvement while being aware of it, fundamentally, unless you figure out a way to replace that old foundation with something new, that completely obliterates everything you believe in by showing you that you assume it, for no reason, other than it having proven itself useful enough to identify as supremely advantageous. Letting go of things like that, it can shatter self identity. They turn us into unrecognizable monsters. It makes us doubt everything about ourselves, and it makes us feel like we can never recover, and even if we do, it will be pointless, because we know what other people will think when they observe us. And we are told to not care what others think. To not take things seriously. To just accept, without making a big fuss, throwing a tantrum, acting like a child, or something ugly, classless, immature, unrefined, uneducated, invalid. If you want to be understood and accepted, more effort, and if effort won\\'t do, I mean, you can either accept it or be forced into acceptance once you realize that accepting it will help you move on and improve, instead of staying in denial for the belief that you are not to blame, for the comfort that offers, even if it becomes obvious that maintaining that deceit hurts more than it helps.\\n\\nDo we all do this, or am I only the one who feels like when I do it, everyone sees it and knows about it? Am I the only one who feels as though I will never have the privacy to grow the way I want to - because I simply can\\'t prove myself trustworthy? Am I the only one who feels like I am being told to accept a mediocre life because that is what people just expect at this point? That if I haven\\'t fixed it by now, it won\\'t ever be fixed? That it\\'s hopeless to expend energy on me? That I might as well just be set aside, ignored, and forgotten, doomed to search for the few, few humans out there that can understand me? Doing this isn\\'t a career or a hobby, it\\'s my life. I wish I could believe in something good, I wish I could feel it naturally, even if I can\\'t understand or explain everything. I wish sometimes people would realize sometimes acceptance is not a good enough solution. \\n\\nAlmost at character limit. Who cares. No one. No one has read all of this at this point. These are the deranged, tangential ramblings of a person who has too much time to think and no clue what to do, someone who is too distracted over all of this to find purpose and meaning in something else. Someone who is inclined to just delete all of this.
